This app was developed before Algorithmia could integrate with GitHub.

1. Clone the repo using Algorithmia

```
git clone https://git.algorithmia.com/git/danielfrg/word2vec.git
```

Make code changes and push will build a new version of the API.

2. Setup Github remote to have it also there

```
git remote add github git@github.com:danielfrg/word2vec-app.git
git push -u github master
```
