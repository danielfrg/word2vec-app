## word2vec

Word Vector functions based on word2vec.

## Data

Model is trained on theon part of Google News dataset (about 100 billion words).

The model contains 300-dimensional vectors for 3 million words and phrases. 

## Usage

There is multiple functions available to query.
The way this works is that you send one (or mutiple as a list) of json queries, where each query is defined as:
    
1. vector: Get vectors for specific words
2. distance: Calculate distances between the combinations of words
3. closest: Get the closest n words and distances to a vector
4. similar: Get the most similar n words and distances to one words
5. analogy: Make word analogies based on positive and negative feedback

### vector

Returns the vector that represent a word.

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| words | List of words |

Example:
    
```json
{
    "vector":{
        "words":[
            "dog",
            "cat"
        ]
    }
}
```

Output:

```json
{
    "vectors":{
        "cat": [0.001, 0.06, ...],
        "dog": [0.02, 0.002, ...]
    }
}
```

### Distance

Returns the distance between all the combinations (r=2) of multiple words.

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| words | List of words |

Example:
    
```json
{
    "distance":{
        "words":["dog", "cat", "fish", "bird"]
    }
}
```

Output:

```json
{
    "distance":[
        ["dog","cat",0.7609457299277049],
        ["dog","fish",0.2331458338686121],
        ["dog","bird",0.4504405095095247],
        ["cat","fish",0.32425707394406234],
        ["cat","bird",0.5146262971059316],
        ["fish","bird",0.49408521392145377]
    ]
}
```

### Closest

Returns the n (default=10) closest words and respective distances to a vector.

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| vector | vector of size 300 as list of numbers |
| n | (default=10) Top N of items to return |

Example:
    
```json
        "vector": [0.02, 0.006, ...], "n": 10
{
    "closest": {

        "vector":
